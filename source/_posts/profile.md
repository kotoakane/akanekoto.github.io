I'm a Ph.D. student in the department of Information and Computer Science at Keio University. I'm part of <a href="http://www.sslab.ics.keio.ac.jp/">System Software Laboratory (sslab)</a> where I'm advised by <a href="http://www.sslab.ics.keio.ac.jp/people/kono/">Kenji Kono</a>. I'm interested in operating systems, cloud computing, and virtualization. My current research focuses on design and implementation of efficient live virtual machine migration in clouds.
